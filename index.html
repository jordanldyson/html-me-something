    <title>My Musical Journey</title>
    <body>
        <p>I've always loved music. My mom put my in piano lessons at the age of 4,
            and it was one of the greatest blessings. My musical interests have
            evolved and become more my own as the years have gone on. We're going to
            explore that together! </p>
